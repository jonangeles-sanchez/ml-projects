# Stock Price Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project in Python

![img.png](img.png)

Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. We will develop this project into two parts:
- First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
- Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.

## About the project

Datasets

- To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL 
  dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages 
  Limited, National Stock Exchange of India: Tata Global Dataset
- To develop the dashboard for stock analysis we will use another stock 
  dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook: Stocks Dataset
