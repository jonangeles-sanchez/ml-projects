Machine learning has significant applications in the stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties. We will develop this project into two parts:
- First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
- Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.

## About the project

Datasets

- To build the stock price prediction model, we will use the NSE TATA GLOBAL 
  dataset. This is a dataset of Tata Beverages from Tata Global Beverages 
  Limited, National Stock Exchange of India: Tata Global Dataset
- To develop the dashboard for stock analysis we will use another stock 
  dataset with multiple stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook: Stocks Dataset

## Prerequisite

The interesting Python project requires you to have basic knowledge of 
Python programming, deep learning with Keras library. Also dash and 
plotly library for building the frontend through a webapp.

We need to install those necessary libraries for this project:
- Numpy, Pandas - for data processing
- TensorFlow - for NN modeling (with LSTM)
- Keras - for DNN modeling
- Matplotlib, Dash, Plotly - For plotting results

using this command:
    pip install numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras, dash, plotly

## Project Plan

- [x] Code model
- [x] Code Dashboard
- [x] Cleanup and document model
