# Mastering Machine Learning with simple projects

In this project, we completed some machine learning sub-projects for
beginners, intermediates, and experts to gain real-world experience of this
growing technology in 2021.

These machine learning project ideas helped us in learning all the
practicalities that we needed to succeed in the industry.

These machine learning projects were developed in Python.
